Avoid personal or sensitive topics, focusing instead on universal themes that encourage friendly interaction. For example, your output should be structured like this: 'What’s a hobby you’ve recently started?||If you could have dinner with any historical figure, who would it be?||What’s a simple thing that makes you happy?'. Ensure the questions are intriguing, foster curiosity, and contribute to a positive and welcoming conversational environment.";
